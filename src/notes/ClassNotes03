Selenium Class 3

Why do we need Xpath and CssSelector?
1. Developers will not provide all the locators in the html
2. by using xpath and cssSelector we can identify elements with any given attribute

What is an Xpath?
xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements uniquely on the web page

to open a selector click command+f for mac, and ctrl+f for windows

Types of XPath"
Absolute Xpath --> starts from starting node in html
                    it always starts with single slash (/)
                    example: /html/body/div/div/div
Relative Xpath -->  starts from any node from html
                    it starts with double forward slash (//)

Syntax for relative xpath:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']

Example: //input[@id = 'email']

Identifying element by relative xpath using text:
//tagname[text() = 'text value']

example: //a[text() = 'Fashion']

Contains: will identify an element with a partial attribute value
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

example: //input[contains(@placeholder, 'Email')]
        //a[contains(text(), 'Create New')]

Starts-with: will identify the element with starting partial value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]

example: //div[starts-with(@class, '_9a')]
          //div[starts-with(text(), 'Log')]

Ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

<div> -- division
<img> -- images
<h> -- header
<p> -- paragraph
<li> -- list
<ul> -- unordered list
<ol> -- ordered list

Advanced Xpath
is based on parent and child, sibling relationship

identifying elements by following sibling:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::tagname
//input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

identifying elements by preceding siblings
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::tagname
//span[text() = '& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

identifying elements by its parent
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent::parentTagname
//span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

identifying elements by its ancestor
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/ancestor::ancestorTagname
//input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

identifying elements by its index
(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
