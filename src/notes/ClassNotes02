Selenium Class 02

What is a Webelement?
Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a web element
e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, dropdowns etc

HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. it is a browser's internal view of the webpage
Also called Developer tools
Document -- can be stored any document, like pdf excel or word
Object -- any line in HTML is called an Object
Model -- it is just a layout of the HTML file in DOM

What is Locator?
Locator is an address or a position of a webelement in the web page
it is used to locate or identify the weblement on the webpage

8 Locators:
ID
Name
ClassName
TagName
CSS
Xpath
LinkText
PartialLinkText

HTML Scripting meaning:
purple -- tags
brown or orange -- attributes
blue -- attribute value

Why do we need so many locators?
-- some locators might have duplicate values
-- Developers might not provide all the locators for the same element
-- Some locators may not be applicable to all the elements
    e.g. linktext partialLinkText are only used for links

"a" tag in HTML is called anchor tag

if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values Selenium will only see the first one and
will only interact with the first element
